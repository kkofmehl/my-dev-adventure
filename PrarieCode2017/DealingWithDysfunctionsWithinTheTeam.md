# Dealing with Dysfunctions within the Team


## Demotivation

Offering extrinsic awards for creativity tends to actually hamper creativity in the long run.
	
If you Do X then you will get Y  (not good for creativity)

Now that you've done X, we will give you Y   (perhaps better for creativity if not abused)

## Intrinsic Motivation
- Autonomy
- Mastery
- Purpose

    Increase Intrinsic Motivation
	- Autonomy in daily work
	- Allowing team to commit to specific work in the sprint
	- Team members choose what they do and how they do it each day
	- Team members can use whatever tools they want
	- Be sure that team members are being challenged with different types of work (donâ€™t silo people)
	- Allowing teams to choose their Epics (based on interest and skill confidence)


## Broken Communications

Promote Autonomy by providing choices
- Open Layout
- Heads Down Space
- Collaboration rooms
- Movable desks

> "Conway's Law"

### Team Names
- Avoid boring names (Team A, Team B, Team 1, Team 2)
- Allow for fun team names. 
- Each team should feel empowered to argue that they are the best team

## Estimation

Avoid hours estimates  (can create jaded developers when they get frustrated with their estimates)
	
People are bad at estimating but good at grouping
	
Do not compare story points between teams.
	
Team Velocity should be judged based on variance, not on velocity
- Commit to 30, complete 28  => GOOD
- Commit to 30, complete 10 => NOT SO GOOD

## Team Members

- Watch out for "fifedoms".  Protecting work for job security.	
- Create a culture of continuous learning	
- The number of software engineers is doubling every 5 years
	
Professional Development Challenge
- Points for various professional development tasks 
- Teams that have the most points are recognized and get a "trophy"

## Leadership
- Should be spread out at all levels of the team.
    - ScrumMasters
    - Product Owners
    - Managers
- Take leadership where it is found (don't discriminate based on experience)

## Team Messaging problems
- We do not care so much about velocity
- Cross-functional != Anyone on the team can/will do everything

## Product Owners
- Prioritizes
- Coordinates with stateholders and teams (50/50)
- Require enough capacity to not be causing churn within the team
