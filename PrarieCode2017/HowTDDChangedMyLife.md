TDD is not only Unit Testing

How does TDD change my code?

1: Code Breaking Code (Looney Tune Code)

- Learned that code could easily be extracted if tests exist
- TDD can help when rolling requests come in from the user (changes)
- TDD gives you the pause to look at your code


## Productivity:

1. Too Many Distractions
    1. Coworkers stopping by
    2. Go to Lunch
    3. Meetings
    4. Leaving early on Friday

>TDD Leaves a trail of breadcrumbs.  Especially if you leave a red-test.  Great place to dive in.
	
2. Not knowing what I did

TDD tells you what you did.  You can see how many tests you've written and passed throughout the day.
	
3. Long Feedback Loop

TDD creates very small loops that minimizes the feedback loop length
	
4. Joining a Project Mid Stream
