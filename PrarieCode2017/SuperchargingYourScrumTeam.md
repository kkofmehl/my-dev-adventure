# Super Charging Your Scrum Team


> Backlog grooming -> Scrum-scaping!


## Story Point Notes:

Exemplar Stories
    -Stories that can be compared to for pointing
    -Find some good stories for every point level
		
Keep the story points in the team as best as possible.  Because the outside business has no clue what an "8" is.
	
	
## Sprint Reviews:
	
- A meeting to get feedback on the work completed during the sprint.
- Meeting should include not just the team but any stake-holders in the work completed
- Go through the stories
    - Have the developer talk about their work
    - Demo the feature/change
    - Ask questions and get feedback
- These can only be successful in the stakeholders take an interest.  
- Can be a great team morale booster (and can also be a morale killer if they are not seen as important).

## Retros

https://plans-for-retrospectives.com/en/?id=130-6-37-61-44

What are we good at and might forget if we don't talk about it?

What did we learn?

What are we going to try differently?

What still puzzles us?

Actionable items from the Retro should actually go on back-log
	
## Information Radiators

To solve problems, they need to be visible.  The tendency is to hide problems.  Don't hide them if you want them to be fixed.
	
	
# Swarm

Tackling issues as a team.  Attacking a ticket/issue as a team.

> Learning and growth as a team comes from failure.
