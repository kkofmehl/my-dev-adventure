## Notes:

> All React components need to start with a Capital Letter

> 	document.querySelector()  => Similar to jQuery.  Can query the DOM using jQuery-esk convention

Notes on "state" vs "props"
- props should be considered immutable.
- state can be managed within the component
    - Always use the setState() method to change the state.

## Lifecycle Methods

> componentWillMount

The component has been created in memory but has not been rendered
(Maybe on its way out.  Most likely replaced by constructor)

>componentDidMount

This happens after the component has rendered.  Only runs in the browser.
		
>	componentWillReceiveProps

> 	componentWillUpdate

>	componentDidUpdate

### Constructor
- "constructor" is the name of the method.
- ALWAYS call the "super" within the constructor.

### Routing
            
>React-router-dom
